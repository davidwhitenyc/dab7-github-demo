Hi, @here! As I mentioned yesterday, I want you to do some things in Git.

First: Pair up with someone else here (I'll let you choose who, and it can be in groups of 2-3). Create a local branch (choose whatever name you want) on the server. Everyone should push and pull into that branch, similar to what we did yesterday with main, except that it'l be your own private branch. To avoid conflicts, everyone should create a file with their own name.
